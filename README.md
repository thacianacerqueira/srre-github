# Pequena História
GitHub a user cancreate code repositories and push code to them.  Every repository has a list ofcollaborators; they can make changes to the content of the repository and they review the contributions that are submitted to the repository,accepting or discarding them. In this sense, they are not the only people collaborating on the project.  In fact, every person that wishes to contribute to a project,  without being acollaborator, can fork it.  This action makes a duplicate ofthe repository, allowing developers to work independently,committing changes only to their own fork.  When developers complete a certain task (e.g., a new feature or a bug fix),they can send the changes to the original repository, through a so-called pull request. Then, a collaborator of the original repository reviews the changes contained in the pull request and decides whether to accept it in the original repository (in the Git jargon,merge it to the parent repository), or refuse it,optionally motivating his or her choice.  Once the new code is accepted in the original repository, its author becomes on of the contributors of the project. In addition to that, GitHub users can follow other users, to be notified of their actions.The website is not used only for collaboration, but also as are source to find quality software.  Users can star interesting repositories that they want to bookmark for later reference. Other features are also available (e.g., issue tracking, downloads, gists, and so on).
